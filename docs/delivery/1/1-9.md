# 1-9 Explicit Flow Node Creation API

## Description
Implement an API command to explicitly create a flow node, with all relevant properties (e.g., name, initial value, min/max, position, etc.). This enables programmatic workflows to match the UI's affordance for adding flow nodes directly.

## Requirements
- Add support for `action: "create", resource: "nodes"` with a property (e.g., `type: "flow"` or `isFlow: true`) to create a flow node.
- Allow specifying properties such as name, initial value, min/max, position, etc.
- Validate input and ensure the node is correctly typed as a flow node.
- Ensure the node appears in the UI and is fully functional.
- Add tests for explicit flow node creation.

## Implementation Plan
1. Review how flow nodes are created in the UI and model.
2. Extend the API handler to support explicit flow node creation.
3. Update documentation and API schema.
4. Add comprehensive tests.

## Verification
- API-created flow nodes behave identically to UI-created flow nodes.
- All relevant tests pass.

## Files Modified
- src/code/sage-api.ts
- src/code/models/graph-store.ts
- Documentation as needed
